Since Alice transmits the Message M and the random number k to Bob, that data can be assumed to be known to an attacker.
The attacker also knows Alice's public key YA.

Upon intercepting the message to Bob the attacker could make arbitrary changes to that message and then calculate a new signature S = M - k * YA wich is equal to how Alice calculates her signature (S = M - k * XA * G).
