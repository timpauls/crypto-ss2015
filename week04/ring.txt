Conditions required of a ring:

1) Closure under addition: CHECK
2) Associativity of addition: CHECK
3) Additive identity: CHECK (a is the identity element)
4) Additive inverse: CHECK (a is the inverse element for a, b is the inverse element for b)
5) Commutativity for addition: CHECK
6) Closure under multiplication: CHECK
7) Associativity of multiplication: CHECK
8) Distributive laws: CHECK

=> S is a ring.
