Alice and Bob exchange the modulus and generator:
modulus 17
generator 5

Alice chooses her secret:
	xA = 4
Alice calculates her public key:
	yA = 5^4 mod 17 = 13

Bob chooses his secret:
	xB = 13
Bob calculates his public key:
	yB = 5^13 mod 17 = 3

Alice and Bob exchange their respective public keys.

Alice calculates the shared key:
	K = yB^xA mod 17 = 13
Bob calculates the shared key:
	K = yA^xB mod 17 = 13

Further communication is encrypted with the shared key (in this case 13).
