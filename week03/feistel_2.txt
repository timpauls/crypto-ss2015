Round 0:
	half1	half2

Round 1:
	half2	half1 XOR half2^{-1}

Round 2:
	half1 XOR half2^{-1}	half2 XOR (half1 XOR half2^{-1})^{-1} = half2 XOR (half1 XOR half2) = half1

Round 3:
	half1	(half1 XOR half2^{-1}) XOR half1^{-1} = 1 XOR half2^{-1} = half2

Round 4: same as round 1
	half2	half1 XOR half2^{-1}

Round 5: same as round 2
Round 6: same as round 3
Round 7: same as round 4 = same as round 1
...
Round 16: same as round 1	

After 16 rounds the output consists of the second half of the original input 
followed by the first half XOR the bitwise complement of the second half.
